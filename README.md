## Gameplay

In this Runner Game you need to get the highest score you can,  
avoiding Obstacles in your way by moving right or left in this hamster wheel.

## Goal
I would finish somehow this game, putting some cool assets and models at least,  
but publish it once finished is not my intention. It's just for demonstration.  

My real intention is to show the code i written for who's interested.  
After this three years of Game Programming course i have really moooore to study  
if i want to work as a Game Developer.
